Custom bépo keyboard layout in place of the traditionnal French azerty. Bépo is basically a French adaptation of the Dvorak one which is an optimized keyboard layout.

The greatest strengths of this layout is the position of the most common special characters for coding. Also, the most used letters with accent are available by
using the ALT GR key.

The biggest difference with the classic bépo layout is the position of the "ç" key.
