# xkb-fr
This is a part of one of the xkb configuration file under debian based distributions and some of redhat's one. I use this file under ubuntu 20.04 and fedora 33.

It's a custom bépo keyboard layout in place of the traditionnal French azerty. Bépo is basically a French adaptation of the Dvorak one which is an optimized keyboard layout.

The greatest strengths of this custom layout is the position of the most common special characters for coding. Also, the most used letters with accent are available by using the ALT GR key.

The biggest difference with the classic bépo layout is the position of the "ç" key.
This layout allows pinyin tones input and German typing too.
