# xkb-fr
This is a part of one of the xkb configuration file under debian and redhat based distributions.
It's a custom BÉPO keyboard layout in place of the traditionnal French AZERTY. 
BÉPO is basically a French adaptation of the Dvorak one which is an optimized keyboard layout. 
The greatest strength of this custom layout is the position of the most common special characters for coding.
This layout allows pīnyīn tones input.
